# TODO

## Backend
 - CRON job calling post every day
 - Configure nginx to gzip everything

## Frontend
 - On click on filter: highlight in menu
 - On click on info button: fix modal
 - Implement screen for no results on search
 - Title of website, missing assets?
 - Cursor icons
 - On click on author: search author
 - Thorough testing and fixing small things

## UX design
 - Logo for Tweet picture for meta tags
 - Toggle sort for filter menu (alphanumeric vs counts)
 - Mobile friendly
 - How to go from single pub view to main site

## Tests

## Misc
