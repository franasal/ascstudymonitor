# TODO

## Backend
 - CRON job calling post every day

## Frontend
 - Go through previous HTML check for missing assets
 - Thorough testing and fixing small things
   - Small horizontal scroll bars on list content  (@felix - still an issue?)
   - On click on info button: modal and content have leaky z-index (text overlaying modal, query bar color)
   - Issues with some names and search, e.g. `/?search=Robin%20Lester%20Carhart-Harris`

## UX design
 - Logo for Tweet picture for meta tags
 - Mobile friendly
 - How to go from single pub view to main site
 - Itâ€™s confusing to click at "Item (2)" and see more than 2 results 

## Tests
 - Test paper download
 - Browser support and consistent UI
 - Unit tests ;-)

## Misc
 - Twitter access tokens conjuren
 - Too many requests on update (maybe in fix file attached?), use cached data instead

# IDEAS
 - Citation generator
 - Dynamic procedural tweet picture generator 
 - Render paper infos in tweet picture
