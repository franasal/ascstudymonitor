# TODO

## Backend
 - CRON job calling post every day
 - Configure nginx to gzip everything

## Frontend
 - Go through previous HTML check for missing assets
 - Click behavior on publication
  - On click on discipline: search discipline
  - On click on author: search author
  - On click on publication: search publication
 - Thorough testing and fixing small things
   - Small horizontal scroll bars on list content  
   - On click on info button: leaky z-index (text overlaying modal, query bar color)

## UX design
 - Logo for Tweet picture for meta tags
 - Toggle sort for filter menu (alphanumeric vs counts)
 - Mobile friendly
 - How to go from single pub view to main site

## Tests
 - Test paper download
 - Browser support and consistent UI
 - Unit tests ;-)

## Misc
 - Twitter access tokens conjuren
 - Too many requests on update (maybe in fix file attached?), use cached data instead
- move sitemap.xml out of client

# IDEAS

 - Dynamic procedural tweet picture generator 
 - Render paper infos in tweet picture
