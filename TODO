# TODO

## Backend
 - CRON job calling post every day
 - Publications returned with duplicate discipline
  ```
    "disciplines": [
        "Psychopharmacology",
        "Psychopharmacology"
    ],
    "id": "52590145-2b2b-30ea-b818-de9ddb49e4a5",
  ```
  - Publications returned without year
   ```
     "id": "a848cdba-dd3e-3db2-ac1d-85d06b166a18",
     "year": null
   ```

## Frontend
 - Thorough testing and fixing small things
   - On click on info button: modal and content have leaky z-index (text overlaying modal, query bar color)
   - Issues with some names and search, e.g. `/?search=Robin%20Lester%20Carhart-Harris`
   - Search by author doesnt work at all
   - Make filter searches specific (when filtering by author, only search on author field)
   - Year filter deselection doesnt work
   - Info modal majorly messed up

## UX design
 - Logo for Tweet picture for meta tags
 - Mobile friendly
 - How to go from single pub view to main site
 - Itâ€™s confusing to click at "Item (2)" and see more than 2 results 
 - Call to action: Make search function more clear

## Tests
 - Test paper download
 - Browser support and consistent UI
 - Unit tests ;-)

## Misc
 - Twitter access tokens conjuren
 - Too many requests on update (maybe in fix file attached?), use cached data instead

# IDEAS
 - Citation generator
 - Dynamic procedural tweet picture generator 
 - Render paper infos in tweet picture
